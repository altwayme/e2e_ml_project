### How to open the port in your remote VM

Port 5444 is used by default. 

If it is closed and web-service is not availiable, then port can be opened in remote VM with the command.

```
ufw allow 5444
```

Port can be changed in app.py in the last lines of code.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, **port=5444**, host='0.0.0.0')
```

### How to run app using docker and which port it uses

Docker imaged can be pulled with this command:

```
docker push altwayme/gsom_project:tagname
```

where tagname should be the latest verions (v.0.4).

---

After that application can be started with this command:

```
sudo docker run --network host -d altwayme/gsom_project:v.0.4
```
